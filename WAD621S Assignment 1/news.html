                     <hr>
                     <p> Advances in science and engineering have lower impact when the humanity side is ignored. For this reason, ICATHâ€™2022 aims at establishing this vital link in order to magnify such benefits. This conference is devoted to practical models and industrial applications related to advanced technologies for Humanity. It is considered as a meeting point for researchers and practitioners to enable the implementation of advanced information technologies into various industries.  </p>
